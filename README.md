# Practice-Project

This is a practice project to help me develop my data science skills.

During this project I practiced using variety of Python libraries to assist with my data analysis. I used Pandas, nltk, regex, matplotlib, scikitlearn and seaborn.

Throughout this project I cleaned data, produced visualisations for my cleaned data and did topic modelling.
